				<h3>Apply for Unemployment Insurance Benefits:</h3>
				<p>
					Those who have lost their jobs or had their hours reduced due to the disasters or related weather conditions are encouraged to apply for <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/unemployment/" target="_blank">Unemployment Insurance benefits</a>. The Governor’s Emergency Proclamation also provides for the waiver of the usual one-week waiting period which means individuals can be paid benefits for the first week they are unemployed.
				</p>

				<h3>Extensions for Employers to File and Pay Payroll Taxes:</h3>
				<p>
					Employers directly affected by the disasters may request up to a 60-day extension of time from the EDD to file their state payroll reports and/or deposit state payroll taxes without penalty or interest. A written request for extension must be received within 60 days from the original delinquent date of the payment or return. For more information about how to request an extension and other employer assistance available, visit <a href="https://www.edd.ca.gov/Payroll_Taxes/Emergency_and_Disaster_Assistance_for_Employers.htm" target="_blank">Emergency and Disaster Assistance for Employers</a>. You can also learn about assistance available through the Internal Revenue Service’s <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Help-During-Disasters" target="_blank">Help During Disasters</a> web page.
				</p>


				<h3>Worker Safety and Health in Wildfire Regions:</h3>

				<p>Wildfire smoke and cleanup presents hazards that employers and workers in affected regions must understand. Smoke from wildfires contains chemicals, gases and fine particles that can harm health. Hazards continue even after fires have been extinguished and cleanup work begins. Proper protective equipment and training is required for worker safety in wildfire regions.</p>

				<p>Power outages can also present electrical and other hazards for workers. Proper installation and use of generators can prevent electrocution hazards. Workers must also be aware of the potential of electrocution or being injured by moving parts of machinery and other equipment when power is restored. Workers can also face health hazards from working without electricity in unventilated areas because ventilation systems are not working. <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/Worker-Health-and-Safety-in-Wildfire-Regions.html" target="_blank">View additional information in protecting outdoor workers</a>.</p>

				<h3>
					Protecting Outdoor Workers for Air Quality:
				</h3>

				<p>
					Cal/OSHA has advised employers that steps must be taken to protect workers
				</p>

				<p>
					from harmful exposure if the air quality is unhealthy due to wildfire smoke. California’s protection from wildfire smoke standard applies to workplaces where the Air Quality Index (AQI) for fine particles in the air is 151 or greater and where workers may be exposed to wildfire smoke.
				</p>

				<p>
					When wildfire smoke affects a worksite, employers must monitor the AQI for particulate matter in the air, known as PM2.5. <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2019/2019-80.pdf" target="_blank">View additional information on air quality</a>
				</p>

				</p>



				<h3>Replacing Lost or Damaged Documents
					
				</h3>
				<p> In conjunction with the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, the DMV helps Californians impacted by natural disasters at temporary local assistance centers. At these centers, the DMV offers limited services to affected residents, who can replace at no cost the following items if lost or damaged due to the disaster: duplicate driver licenses, identification cards, vehicle registration and title, and disabled person parking placards. In addition, they can acquire substitute license plates and stickers, vehicle disposal paperwork, and driver record printouts, as well as initiate a change of address.</p>
				<p>Details on assistance centers are released as information becomes available.                </p>
				<p>Fire victims who need to replace lost or damaged DMV-related documents can do so free of charge at a local DMV field office. </p>


				<h3>Visiting CDCR prisons</h3>

				<p>Before visiting a loved one in a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation prison, it is always recommended - in particular during periods of potential power outages - to check <a href="https://visitorreservations.cdcr.ca.gov/VisitingStatus.aspx" target="_blank">CDCR’s visiting website</a> in advance. It includes institution-specific information. (Note: When an institution's power from the grid is interrupted, the prison switches to generator power. While that allows critical functions to continue, it is common for services such as visiting to be limited or canceled.)</p>

				<h3>Consumer Alerts</h3>
				<p>California Attorney General Xavier Becerra has issued a consumer alert reminding all Californians that price gouging during a state of emergency is illegal under Penal Code Section 396. California law generally prohibits charging a price that exceeds, by more than 10 percent, the price of an item before a state or local declaration of emergency. This law applies to those who sell food, emergency supplies, medical supplies, building materials, and gasoline. The law also applies to repair or reconstruction services, emergency cleanup services, transportation, freight and storage services, hotel accommodations, and rental housing. Exceptions to this prohibition exist if, for example, the price of labor, goods, or materials has increased for the business. Victims or witnesses of potential price gouging may file a complaint through the Office of the Attorney General by calling <a href="tel:18009525225">(800) 952-5225</a>, online at <a href="https://www.oag.ca.gov/report" target="_blank">https://www.oag.ca.gov/report</a>, or by contacting their local police department or sheriff’s office.

						 Information from the California Department of Education (CDE) on Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) and Wildfire incidents.
				</h3>
				<div>
				
						<p>Your child’s health and safety is a top priority during an unforeseen event such as a Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) and/or a wildfire incident. During a PSPS event, the California Department of Education recommends that parents contact their respective schools and expanded and early learning and care programs to consider.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Is access to the school and/or expanded and early learning and care site impeded?</li>
		 
		<li>Will the school and/or expanded and early learning and care program be able to provide adequate supervision?</li>
		 
		<li>Is backup power available and/or does the site have adequate daylighting?</li>
		 
		<li>Will the school and/or expanded and early learning and care program have safe drinking water and functioning bathrooms?</li>
		 
		<li>Can the site maintain fire and life safety via alarms or backup monitoring?</li>
		 
		<li>Will the school and/or expanded and early learning and care program be able to serve meals?</li>
		 
		<li>Will the school be able to maintain student support services (e.g., health and counseling)?</li>

					</ul>
					
					<p>For wildfire incidents, if your children’s school and/or expanded and early learning and care program is not directly threatened by a wildfire, the factor of air quality is a primary consideration. You can visit <a href="https://airnow.gov" target="_blank">https://airnow.gov</a> to obtain real-time, local air quality conditions. If air quality becomes unsafe or if local regulatory monitors indicate high levels of particulate matter in the air, keep children indoors where the air is filtered.</p>

					<p>Information regarding health and the effects of smoke and ash can be found on the website for the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) at <a href="https://calepa.ca.gov/disaster/fire/" target="_blank">https://calepa.ca.gov/disaster/fire/</a> These up-to-date FAQs and guidance documents contain much of the information that your district and school administrators can use to make safety and clean-up decisions.</p>
